# ZOOM

A DOOM clone written in Zig.

I am using Cursor almost exclusively to write the code for this project. This is a learning exercise to see how best to use Cursor for a complex project that I don't already have experience with. This is my first Zig project, and I don't have much experience with game development either. Should be fun!

## Requirements

- Zig nightly (Built with 0.14.0-dev)
- SDL2 (install via your system package manager)
  - macOS: `brew install sdl2`
  - Linux: `apt install libsdl2-dev` or equivalent
  - Windows: Install SDL2 development libraries
