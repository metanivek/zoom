## Technical Notes

### Memory Management
- Use arena allocators for level data
- Fixed-size allocators for frequently allocated objects
- Careful management of texture and sprite resources

### Math Implementation
- Fixed-point arithmetic for compatibility
- Binary Angle Measurement (BAM) for rotations
- Lookup tables for performance

### Dependencies
- SDL2 for window management and input (currently dynamically linked)
- (Optional) SDL2_mixer for audio
