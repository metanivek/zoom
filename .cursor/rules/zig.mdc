# Zig Rules To Always Follow

## Tests
- To run tests: `zig build test`
- Always put tests in the file under test. Never create a new file just to hold tests.
- When adding tests to a new module make sure to include it in the test at the bottom of [main.zig](mdc:src/main.zig)

## Debug utilities / general running
- When asked to run something, always consult [build.zig](mdc:build.zig) to know how to run it
- There is always a doom1.wad file in the root of the project that can be used for debugging
