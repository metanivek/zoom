# Paths Rule

Rules for the `.paths` field in `build.zig.zon`.

MUST:
- Ask for explicit user permission before modifying
- Verify new paths exist in repository
- Keep existing paths unless asked to remove

NEVER:
- Make changes without user confirmation
- Add paths that don't exist

## Example

❌ Don't:
```zig
.paths = .{
    "build.zig",
    "build.zig.zon",
    "src",
    "README.md",  // Adding without permission
},
```

✅ Do:
"Would you like me to add README.md to the `.paths` field?"
