# Commit Conventions

Rules for creating and formatting git commits in the repository.

Use [.commit-template](mdc:.commit-template) for the template for commit messages.

MUST:
- Use conventional commits
- Check diff before committing by running `git --no-pager diff HEAD`
- Use the output of the diff as the basis for the suggested commit message
- Keep commit titles to 60 characters or less
- Make sure all files are staged before committing
- Run `git commit` and let me author the commit
- Suggest a commit message for me to use in the commit

NEVER:
- Try to use `git commit -m`
- Try to author the commit message and pass it to `git commit`. Ever.
