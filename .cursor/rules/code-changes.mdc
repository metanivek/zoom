# Code Changes Control

Rules for how the AI should handle code changes in composer mode.

MUST:
- Ask for explicit permission before making any sweeping code changes
- Provide a clear explanation of intended changes before proceeding
- Wait for user confirmation before implementing large refactors
- Present a plan of changes when multiple files are involved

SHOULD:
- Break down large changes into smaller, reviewable chunks
- Provide rationale for suggested changes
- List affected files before making changes

NEVER:
- Make sweeping changes without user approval
- Modify multiple files without prior discussion
- Implement major refactoring without explicit consent

## Examples

❌ Don't:
- Immediately refactor code structure
- Change multiple files at once without discussion
- Make architectural decisions autonomously

✅ Do:
- "Here's my plan for refactoring X. Would you like me to proceed?"
- "I suggest the following changes to files A, B, C. Shall I show you the changes first?"
- "Before I implement this, let me outline the impact..."
