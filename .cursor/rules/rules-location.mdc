# Cursor Rules Location

Rules for placing rule files in the repository.

MUST:
- Place all rule files in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g. `my-rule.mdc`)
- Use `.mdc` extension
- Use descriptive names that reflect the rule's purpose

NEVER:
- Place rules in project root
- Place rules in subdirectories outside `.cursor/rules`
- Use other file extensions

## Example

❌ Don't:
```
rules/my-rule.mdc
my-rule.mdc
.rules/my-rule.mdc
```

✅ Do:
```
.cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
```
